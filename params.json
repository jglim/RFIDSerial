{"name":"RFIDSerial","tagline":"Usable serial data from a cheap RFID reader via Teensy 2.0","body":"RFIDSerial\r\n=========\r\n\r\nGet usable serial data from your cheap RFID readers!\r\n\r\n  - Uses Teensy 2.0 (since there is a USB serial *and* a hardware serial)\r\n  - Reads and converts raw data into the card's 10 digit ID\r\n  - Outputs the data into the serial (separated by newlines)\r\n  \r\nI recently bought one of those affordable (~US$10) chinese RFID readers. Unfortunately the device only outputs to USB (appears as a keyboard). I wanted the output via the serial port as it was inconvenient that the RFID reader hijacks your keyboard everytime a card is scanned, hence I created this project.\r\n\r\nUsing a logic analyser, I noticed that the pin labeled TX sends a serial output ``(bit rate: 9600)`` when a card is scanned. The format is as follows\r\n\r\n``[card digit] [240] [card digit] ``\r\nrepeated 10 times\r\n\r\nI am not sure what the format for encoding the number is. However, since the character space should only span [0-9], I chose to decode it via a lookup table. \r\nPlease note that this table is incomplete - help would be appreciated! (see caveats)\r\n\r\nHow to use\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nYour RFID reader must be similar or exactly the same as mine - [this was the one I purchased.](http://www.aliexpress.com/snapshot/211636793.html)\r\nOn the board, there should be a few test points. The one we are interested in is the serial TX (refer to image)\r\n\r\n![RFID Board](https://raw.github.com/jglim/RFIDSerial/master/Images/rfid1.png)\r\n\r\n1. Connect the TX pin from the reader to the RX pin of your Teensy (Pin 7/D2)\r\n2. Connect the RFID board's ground to your Teensy's ground\r\n3. Upload the sketch using Teensyduino\r\n\r\nTo prevent keystrokes being sent to the computer while supplying power, I believe it is possible to tape the USB data lines, leaving only 5V and GND\r\n\r\nCaveats\r\n--------------\r\n* The first digit is occassionally not sent (check whether the output's ``length == 10``)\r\n* The digits ``4,7,8`` are not implemented! It would be great if someone has a RFID card with those digits and can help add them!\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
